    <h1 id="intoHeading"> <h7 id="introHeadingKeyWord">Eclpise,</h7><br> An eclipse, a celestial phenomenon, captivates with its poetic dance of shadows and light. It unfolds as the moon, akin to a silent, silver swan, traverses the heavens, obscuring the fiery sun. Daylight turns to twilight as the moon's passage casts a fleeting shroud. Yet, amidst the darkness, the sun's radiant corona emerges, a fiery halo, offering a glimpse of its eternal brilliance. This ethereal alignment, a reminder of nature's exquisite design, leaves a mesmerized world below, awestruck by the cosmic interplay. An eclipse is a celestial waltz, a testament to the universe's majesty, a fleeting moment of sublime beauty.: <br><br>

<div id="lustDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="lustHeading"> <h7 id="lustHeadingKeyWord">How do eclipses occur?, </h7><br> Eclipses occur when the Sun, Moon, and Earth align in a specific way. There are two main types of eclipses: solar and lunar. During a solar eclipse, the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun's light either partially (partial eclipse) or completely (total eclipse). During a lunar eclipse, the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon, which can cause it to appear reddish in color. <br><br>

<div id="guttonyDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="guttonyHeading"> <h7 id="guttonyHeadingKeyWord">Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time? , </h7><br> Eclipses are visible only from certain parts of the Earth's surface during a specific time. This is because the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth creates a shadow that falls on a specific region. People in the shadow's path witness the eclipse, while those outside the path do not. <br><br>
</div>

<div id="greedDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="greedHeading"> <h7 id="greedHeadingKeyWord">What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?, </h7><br> The alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth is due to the orbits of these celestial bodies. The Moon orbits Earth, and Earth orbits the Sun. Eclipses occur when these orbits intersect in such a way that they align in a straight line. <br><br>
</div>

<div id="slothDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="slothHeading"> <h7 id="slothHeadingKeyWord">How often do eclipses occur? , </h7><br> Eclipses occur several times a year, but not necessarily at every full moon (lunar eclipse) or new moon (solar eclipse). The frequency depends on the alignment of the orbits. On average, there are about 2 to 5 solar eclipses and 2 to 4 lunar eclipses annually. <br><br>
</div>

<div id="wrathDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="wrathHeading"> <h7 id="wrathHeadingKeyWord">How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?, </h7><br> Scientists use precise mathematical calculations and astronomical data to predict when and where eclipses will occur. The study of the orbits of the Moon and Earth allows astronomers to create eclipse tables and models that can forecast eclipses years in advance. <br><br>
</div>

<div id="envyDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="envyHeading"> <h7 id="envyHeadingKeyWord">What is the difference between a lunar and solar eclipse?, </h7><br> Solar Eclipse: Occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, blocking the Sun's light. There are three types: total, partial, and annular, depending on the alignment and apparent size of the Moon.
        Lunar Eclipse: Occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. Lunar eclipses are typically total, partial, or penumbral, with the Moon sometimes appearing reddish due to Earth's atmosphere scattering sunlight. .<br><br>

<div id="prideDiv" class="sin">
    <h1 id="prideHeading"> <h7 id="prideHeadingKeyWord">What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months (or twice a year)? , </h7><br> Eclipse seasons are periods during which eclipses are more likely to occur, approximately every six months. This is because the Moon's orbit is inclined relative to Earth's orbit around the Sun. During eclipse seasons, the nodes (points where the orbits intersect) align with the Sun and Earth, increasing the chances of eclipses. Eclipse seasons usually last for about 34 days, during which multiple solar and lunar eclipses may occur. <br><br>

        Eclipse, a cosmic ballet of shadows and light,
Where the moon and sun engage in their celestial fight.
In the depths of the vast and starry night,
They dance together, casting shadows in their flight.
<br><br>
The moon, a silent, silver swan in the dark,
Passes before the fiery sun, leaving its mark.
As the sun's brilliance begins to wane and hark,
A twilight cloak descends, creating a mystic spark.
<br><br>
The world below, in awe of this celestial show,
Watches as day turns into night, a surreal tableau.
The sun's corona, a halo of fiery glow,
Peeks through the moon's embrace, an ethereal hello.
<br><br>
Eclipse, a reminder of nature's grand design,
A moment when two worlds gracefully align.
In this dance of shadows, both yours and mine,
We find beauty in the cosmic, the divine.<br><br>
